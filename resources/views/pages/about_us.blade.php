                <h1 style="font-weight: bold; ">OUR APPROACH</h1>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">From the moment you contact our design center regarding your
                   project, we will be available to answer your questions and walk you through each step of the
                   way. The process begins with an initial consultation where one of our team members comes out
                   to take a look at your property, takes measurements, and identifies what your goals for the
                   project will be. We will also provide you with an estimated start date and length or time
                   frame of project. We will then take this information and contact you with the cost of your
                   project. At this time, we would recommend visiting our 5,000 square foot indoor design
                   center (located at 336 Centennial Ave Cranford, NJ) to view various materials and gain
                   inspiration that may be applicable to your project. Our Design center features outdoor
                   kitchens, grills, fireplaces, fire pits, water features, lighting and over 100 different
                   stone, brick and paver applications and more.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                   Unlike other companies, we have a staff
                   dedicated to making sure your project runs smoothly. Along with an onsite foreman, our
                   supervisor will be there throughout the day to evaluate the progress. Jeff’s Landscape
                   Design & Construction is truly a one-stop shop. Our crews specialize in different expertise,
                   from our expert masons, construction crews, landscape crews and maintenance crews. Jeff’s
                   Landscape is diversified in every aspect of the design and construction industry. We are
                   confident that our portfolio, blend of talent and work ethic, enables us to provide the
                   highest quality of service to our clients.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                   While some clients look to be very much involved
                   in the design process, others leave the design to us. Whatever type of person you are we
                   will make it enjoyable and a great experience for you to remember. Our ability to
                   communicate with our clients is something that we pride ourselves on almost as much as the
                   end of the completed design.
